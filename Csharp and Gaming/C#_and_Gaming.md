# C# and Gaming

Many students enter the C# course because they hear "C# is a popular language for making video games." This is because C# is a memory-efficient, object-oriented programming language, two things that are ideal for creating video games! 

When we talk about creating video games in C#, the first program out of most people's mouths is [Unity](https://unity.com/). Unity is an extremely powerful and robust program that is designed for many purposes, but one of its most popular features is its game development platform. New and experienced users alike can download Unity for free and quickly get to building video games after just a few tutorials. 

You do not need to know C# to use Unity! However, if you want to get the most use out of it, then knowing C# will allow you to use Unity to its full potential. If you have made it all the way to the back of this course, then you should already be familiar with the basic syntax of C# and feel comfortable working within a C# project. This knowledge will help you pick up learning Unity even faster!

## Getting Started

To begin, you will need to [download Unity](https://unity.com/download) to your computer. Unity is free to download, however, they do ask that if you use Unity to create work that generates yearly revenue above a certain threshold to consider buying their product. Since you are just starting out, you do not meet these standards and are eligible for the free version. It still comes with all the bells and whistles we need to build amazing projects!

Be sure to check the system requirements before downloading Unity. You do not need the most powerful computer available to run Unity, but you should make sure you have what you need to allow the program to run smoothly. 

Downloading Unity will also download the Unity Hub. This is where you will be able to manage your installations and create new projects. It is one of many handy tools that will come with the full Unity package. 

You will also likely need to acquire and enter a product key to fully activate your download. Follow the instructions provided by the Unity website to make sure you have everything you need set up and fully authorized. 

## Templates

Unity comes with a variety of templates to get you started. You can create 2D, 3D, AR (augmented reality), VR (virtual reality), and many more types of games and applications. Explore what Unity has to offer and think about what it is you are interested in. Do you want to create mobile games, a 3D video game, or perhaps a VR experience? There are various routes you can take to get started. 

Unity even offers pre-made assets for platformers, racing, and other types of games to give you a head-start on learning and building projects. 

## Tutorials

Once you have picked a direction you want to try, the next step is finding tutorials. Unity has been around for a long time, and the number of resources out there for teaching you about Unity is endless. 

The absolute best place to start is Unity's very own [tutorial website](https://learn.unity.com/). It is stocked with various tutorials of all kinds and all skill levels to help take your skills from beginner to expert. 

If you would like to continue learning from a Coding Dojo instructor, [here is a link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTQMnrBWdoNO9SVJt-KxN8wzd3RvCjTty) to a playlist of Unity demos done during past courses. The tutorials in this playlist are aimed at beginners and include a 2D platformer, a memory matching game, a basic 3D roll-a-ball game, and other tutorials to get your creative juices flowing. Please note that most of these demos use older versions of Unity, and your interface may not exactly match the interface seen in the videos.
